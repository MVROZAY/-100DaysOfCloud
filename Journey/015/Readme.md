# Configure At Rest Encryption for EFS

## Cloud Research

Create an Amazon Elastic File System in the US-East-1 Region with encryption enabled. Configure mount targets for this file system, enforce encryption in-flight, and finally mount the file system to a pre-created EC2 instance.

- Create an EFS File System Named “devshare” with Encryption Enabled

- Create Mount Targets for EFS Using the EFSMountSecurityGroup in Each Availability Zone

- Apply a File System Policy to the EFS Volume to Enforce In-Transit Encryption for All Clients

- Mount the EFS Volume to the EC2 Instance and Create a File on the Elastic File System
