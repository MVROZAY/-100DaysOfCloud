# Transit Gateway with R53

## Cloud Research

- Setup a Transit gareway for a Multi-VPC Environment

- Used Route 53 to create a private hosted zone and associate the peered VPC with the hosted zone. 

- To get started, i created a peer relationship between the VPCS. Then i validated connectivity between the VPC peers by pinging the host by the FQDN created in Route 53.
