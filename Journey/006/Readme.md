- Comparing the Network Load Balancer and the Application Load Balancer. Prepared the AWS environment for the Network Load Balancer (configuring subnets, network ACL, and EC2 instances). 

- Created and configured a Network Load Balancer. Then 

- Used CLI to run a small test on the Load Balancer and view the results in the CloudWatch Monitor.
