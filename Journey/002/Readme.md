# VPC 101

## Cloud Research

- Created a VPC with public and private subnet in different availability zones

- Created two network access control lists (nacls), and associate each with the proper subnet

- Connected an internet gateway, to the VPC

- Created two route tables, and associate them with the correct subnet

- Created 2 EC2 instances, One in a priv subnet and one in a pub subnet (Modified Pub subnet to auto assign pub ip to ec2 instances)

- Created a Bastion Host in a pub subnet so that i could access my priv ec2 instance 

- Installed a NAT Gateway so that my Priv EC2 Instance could access internet.
